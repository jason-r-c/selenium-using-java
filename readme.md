## Issues Building the project

If there are any issues with building the project try setting the java compiler to 1.7

see "To avoid such error, You should change java compiler to early version 1.7 or 1.7 from configuring build path." from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52245708/the-type-org-openqa-selenium-chrome-chromedriver-is-not-accessible

## Creating project - dont create 'module-info java file'

When creating a new project, do NOT create a 'module-info java file', based on past experience this has caused issues previously. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52158125/how-to-get-eclipse-to-stop-asking-to-create-a-module-info-java-file-on-new-java

## Display editor in IDE
When launching eclipse and the workspace (should be the default seleciton) click the Workbench icon on the right hand side. This then the displays the code editor.
